# Stock Market Prediction App

## Overview
The **Stock Market Prediction App** is a Python-based application designed to predict stock prices using historical data. The application leverages **Linear Regression** to forecast the next day's stock price based on the previous day's closing price. The app also visualizes the actual vs. predicted prices through plots and provides a prediction for the next day's stock price.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Uses historical stock data (from a CSV file) to predict the next day's stock price using **Linear Regression**.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays a plot comparing the actual and predicted stock prices.
- **Next Day Prediction**: Outputs the predicted stock price for the next day based on the latest available data.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple setup to get started, including a script to generate sample data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before using the Stock Market Prediction App, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You'll also need to install the required dependencies:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   - To install the required Python libraries, use `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
     ```

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - If you're using Git, you can clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git
     cd stock-market-prediction
     ```

2. **Generate the Dataset**:
   - Run the `create_csv.py` script to generate a CSV file (`your_dataset.csv`) with sample historical stock data.
     ```bash
     python create_csv.py
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - After generating the dataset, run the `main.py` script to train the model and make predictions.
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **View Results**:
   - The app will display a plot comparing actual vs predicted stock prices, and it will print the predicted stock price for the next day in the console.

## Usage

1. **Create Dataset**:
   - First, run the `create_csv.py` script to generate the `your_dataset.csv` file. This file contains historical stock data.

2. **Prediction**:
   - After the dataset is created, run the `main.py` script. The app will:
     - Load the stock market data from the CSV file.
     - Train a Linear Regression model to predict the stock price.
     - Plot the actual vs predicted stock prices.
     - Output the predicted closing price for the next day.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - **Plot**: A line chart will appear showing the actual and predicted stock prices.
   - **Prediction**: The predicted stock price for the next day will be printed on the console, such as:
     ```
     Predicted next day's close price: 136.5
     ```

## Example Output
After running `main.py`, you will see the following:
- A plot comparing the actual and predicted stock prices.
- The predicted price for the next day printed on the console, such as:
  ```
  Predicted next day's close price: 136.5
  ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and loading CSV files.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the Linear Regression model.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting the actual vs predicted stock prices.

## Future Improvements
- **Advanced Models**: Integrate more sophisticated machine learning models like **Random Forest** or **LSTM** for better prediction accuracy.
- **Real-time Data**: Integrate APIs to fetch real-time stock market data, such as from **Yahoo Finance** or **Alpha Vantage**.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement additional performance evaluation metrics like **R-squared**, **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**, and **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**.
