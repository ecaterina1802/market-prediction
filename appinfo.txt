Application Name: Stock Market Prediction App

Version: 1.0

Description:
This application predicts stock prices using historical data. It uses machine learning (Linear Regression) to predict the closing price of a stock based on the previous day's closing price. The application visualizes the actual vs predicted stock prices and prints out the predicted price for the next day.

Features:
- Load stock market data from a CSV file.
- Predict future stock prices based on previous day's closing price.
- Plot actual vs predicted stock prices.
- Print the predicted stock price for the next day.

How to Use:
1. Run the `create_csv.py` script to generate a CSV file with historical stock data.
2. Run the `main.py` script to train a model and predict stock prices.
3. The app will display the actual and predicted stock prices in a plot.
4. The predicted closing price for the next day will be printed in the console.

Dependencies:
- pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning model (Linear Regression).
- matplotlib: For plotting graphs.

Installation:
1. Install dependencies:
   Run the following command to install the required libraries:

2. Run the application:
Execute `main.py` after ensuring that the CSV file `your_dataset.csv` is created.
